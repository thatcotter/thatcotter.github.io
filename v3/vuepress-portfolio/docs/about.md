Hey, bud! I'm Andrew, a developer/designer from Philly working in NYC. I make interactive experiences that are surprising, fun, and honest.
:::

I like to make things that have both physical and digital dimensions to them. I have a BS in Industrial Design from The University of the Arts and an MFA in Design and Technology from Parsons. I like to converge these two feilds in the form of interactive installations and games. I'm always looking at our relationships to technology and the ways we wield it: how it does things for us, and to us. When I'm not busy making things, I enjoy exploring the city, sharing cheesy puns with friends, or trying to develop a new skill like knitting or meditation.

For my day job, I'm currently freelancing as a Creative Coder for various immersive design agencies in the NYC area. I also teach graduate-level courses at schools like Parsons, usually teaching students how to make art, games, and installations with code. When I'm not coding for money, I'm also involved with LiveCode.NYC, a collective of tech artist who use live programming to create audio-visual performances.
