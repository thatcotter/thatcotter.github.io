While working as a Creative Technologist at [Local Projects](https://localprojects.com/work/ABB), we worked closely with ABB’s global Customer Experience & Innovation team in Zurich, devising a modular approach enabling a new generation of customer experience centers that rethink how space can augment collaboration and creativity. The first instance of the concept has a permanent home in ABB’s Corporate Research Center in Ladenburg, Germany, and also anchored ABB’s global customer conference in Houston. These initial installations were just the start of a multi-year effort by ABB’s Customer Experience team to establish similar centers around the world.
