This project was an assignment for [New Arcade](https://new-arcade.tumblr.com/), a class focused on making unconventional controllers for video games. Inspired by media like Sailor Moon, Pacific Rim, and games like QWOP, we made a game centered around flying a magical robot with a friend through motion-based controls. By waving your arms, you and your partner will guide the rocket thrusters of your robot as a sort of three-legged-race to avoid asteroids and save earth.
