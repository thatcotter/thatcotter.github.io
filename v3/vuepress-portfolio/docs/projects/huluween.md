As one of Hulu’s largest brand tentpole campaigns, we were tasked with introducing Huluween through an immersive and thrilling web experience. It is a celebration of fandom and love for spooky and scary TV during the most creative and expressive of holidays. In the spirit of the spooky season, Hulu invited us to explore the core creative motif and cathartic release of…screaming.
